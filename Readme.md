# Smart File Manager

An out of the box file manager. Periodically analyzes the directories and generate analysis.
Provide advanced file transfer interface.
Scan for duplicate content.
Spot files that do not possibly belong to the folder

## Getting Started

The project is in initial stage of development and all suggestions are welcome at aumdevsinh19@gmail.com.
To get an overview of the project please refer the diagram www.pyscript.com/smart_filemanager/uml/Flow_progress.html

### Prerequisites

Currently to view the application download the folder and run the Scratch_pad.py to see the misfit files.
Enter path and press start.
To view the auto file transfer. Enter the details in configuration.xlsx and run the View.py.

I would recommend caution trying the file transfer as it will transfer the contents of directory based on configuration.xlsx

In next few weeks 1st stable .exe version of the project will be available with neat documentation, 

Till then feel free to play with the code!!
